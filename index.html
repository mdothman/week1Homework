        <img id="self" src="assets/images/name.jpg">
        <p>Hello, my name is Muhi-Dean Othman, but my friends call me Dean. I am currently living in Westminster, and I am working at a Pizza place called "MOD Pizza." I first went to college when I was 16 years old, after I had tested out of highschool.
            My major at the time was Political Science.</p>
        <p> Now I am looking forward to having a future as a full-stack developer. The thing that realy attracted me towards this field was my childhood. I grew up when computers were becoming a really big thing, and I was always fascinated by how you could
            go onto the computer and acquire virtually anything you wanted.</p>
        <p> When I was younger I would go online via dial-up internet, and I thought it was really cool. Then, as I grew older I was really interested in downloading music I had never listened to before, playing flash games, and even uploading my own home
            movies.
        </p>
        <p> While I was going to school, I used computers for everything, but I never understood how they worked.</p>
        <p> Now it feels like I am finally pursuing my dreams and becoming a web developer.</p>
