            <hr>

            <p>Hello, my name is Muhi-Dean Othman, but my friends call me Dean. I am currently living in Westminster, and I am wokring at a Pizza place calle "MOD Pizza." I first went to college when I was 16 years old, after I had tested out of highschool. My major at the time was Political Science.</p>
            <p> Now I am looking forward to having a future as a full-stack developer. I have always been attracted to programming and design from a young age.</p>
            <p> The most exciting thing about this career change will be the new things I will be learning. I have always wanted to be a computer competant person, and have always had an interest in programming.</p>
